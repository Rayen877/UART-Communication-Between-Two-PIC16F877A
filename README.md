# UART-Communication-Between-Two-PIC16F877A
This project demonstrates serial communication between two PIC16F877A microcontrollers using the UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) protocol.
The implementation is done in MPLAB X IDE with XC8 compiler, and the system is simulated in Proteus.
